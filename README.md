# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

### The repo contains the programming assignment from the course.
  
  1. Download the datasset and unzip it from the course webpage.
  2. Run the run_analysis code file in RStudio to get the results.
  
### The objectives of the assignment are given below:

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each      subject.
  
### Code Explanation:
  
  The code merged the training and testing datasets and extracted the required variables. Then creates a new dataset with average of all     the variables and is a tidy dataset.
